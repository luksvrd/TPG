## Description

A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team & generates an HTML webpage displaying summaries for each person.

## Installation

The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly:

- This Generator assumes you have a 'complete dev environment' setup - a terminal, Node, & VS Code. To get started, Fork the repository and clone the new repo from your Github to your local computer. `cd` into the cloned repo and enter: `npm i`

- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. Just do `npm test` or `npm t`.

## Usage

Once you `cd` into the repo, the application will be invoked by using the following command: `node src/index.js`. Answer the prompts about your team and your static HTML page will be generated at the end. Link to Application Walkthrough Video: (https://youtu.be/D6IKXb9rmXU)
